# Ballerina Performance Test Results

During each release, we execute various automated performance test scenarios and publish the results.

| Test Scenarios | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Passthrough HTTP service (h1c -> h1c) | An HTTP Service, which forwards all requests to an HTTP back-end service. |
| Passthrough HTTPS service (h1 -> h1) | An HTTPS Service, which forwards all requests to an HTTPS back-end service. |
| JSON to XML transformation HTTP service | An HTTP Service, which transforms JSON requests to XML and then forwards all requests to an HTTP back-end service. |
| JSON to XML transformation HTTPS service | An HTTPS Service, which transforms JSON requests to XML and then forwards all requests to an HTTPS back-end service. |
| Passthrough HTTP/2(over TLS) service (h2 -> h2) | An HTTPS Service exposed over HTTP/2 protocol, which forwards all requests to an HTTP/2(over TLS) back-end service. |
| Passthrough HTTP/2(over TLS) service (h2 -> h1) | An HTTPS Service exposed over HTTP/2 protocol, which forwards all requests to an HTTPS back-end service. |
| Passthrough HTTP/2(over TLS) service (h2 -> h1c) | An HTTPS Service exposed over HTTP/2 protocol, which forwards all requests to an HTTP back-end service. |
| HTTP/2 client and server downgrade service (h2 -> h2) | An HTTP/2(with TLS) server accepts requests from an HTTP/1.1(with TLS) client and the HTTP/2(with TLS) client sends requests to an HTTP/1.1(with TLS) back-end service. Both the upstream and the downgrade connection is downgraded to HTTP/1.1(with TLS). |

Our test client is [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/index.html). We test each scenario for a fixed duration of
time. We split the test results into warmup and measurement parts and use the measurement part to compute the
performance metrics.

A majority of test scenarios use a [Netty](https://netty.io/) based back-end service which echoes back any request
posted to it after a specified period of time.

We run the performance tests under different numbers of concurrent users, message sizes (payloads) and back-end service
delays.

The main performance metrics:

1. **Throughput**: The number of requests that the Ballerina service processes during a specific time interval (e.g. per second).
2. **Response Time**: The end-to-end latency for an operation of invoking a Ballerina service. The complete distribution of response times was recorded.

In addition to the above metrics, we measure the load average and several memory-related metrics.

The following are the test parameters.

| Test Parameter | Description | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario Name | The name of the test scenario. | Refer to the above table. |
| Heap Size | The amount of memory allocated to the application | 2G |
| Concurrent Users | The number of users accessing the application at the same time. | 100, 300, 1000 |
| Message Size (Bytes) | The request payload size in Bytes. | 50, 1024 |
| Back-end Delay (ms) | The delay added by the back-end service. | 0 |

The duration of each test is **900 seconds**. The warm-up period is **300 seconds**.
The measurement results are collected after the warm-up period.

A [**c5.xlarge** Amazon EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) was used to install Ballerina.

The following are the measurements collected from each performance test conducted for a given combination of
test parameters.

| Measurement | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Error % | Percentage of requests with errors |
| Average Response Time (ms) | The average response time of a set of results |
| Standard Deviation of Response Time (ms) | The “Standard Deviation” of the response time. |
| 99th Percentile of Response Time (ms) | 99% of the requests took no more than this time. The remaining samples took at least as long as this |
| Throughput (Requests/sec) | The throughput measured in requests per second. |
| Average Memory Footprint After Full GC (M) | The average memory consumed by the application after a full garbage collection event. |

The following is the summary of performance test results collected for the measurement period.

|  Scenario Name | Concurrent Users | Message Size (Bytes) | Back-end Service Delay (ms) | Error % | Throughput (Requests/sec) | Average Response Time (ms) | Standard Deviation of Response Time (ms) | 99th Percentile of Response Time (ms) | Ballerina GC Throughput (%) | Average Ballerina Memory Footprint After Full GC (M) |
